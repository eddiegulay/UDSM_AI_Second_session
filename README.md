# demonstrating class inheritance
```python

    pass


class Fox(Dog):
    def bark(self):

# creating a dog object```python

greek_hound = Dog("Greek Hound")

# print dog name (public attribute)
```python
print("public Dog Name: ", greek_hound.name)
```

# calling the bark method of the dog object
```python
greek_hound.bark()
```

# print dog age (private attribute)
```python
print("Private Dog Age: ", greek_hound.get_age())
```

# set dog age (private attribute)
```python
greek_hound.set_age(3)
```

# get the updated dog age
```python
print("Updated Dog Age: ", greek_hound.get_age())
```

# updating dog age publicly
```python
greek_hound.__age = 4  # this will not change the age of the dog
print("Failed Attempt to update age: ", greek_hound.get_age())
```

# creating a puppy object
```python
puppy = Puppy("Puppy")
```

# print puppy name (public attribute)
```python
print("public Puppy Name: ", puppy.name)
```

# calling the bark method of the puppy object
```python
puppy.bark()
```

# print puppy age (private attribute)
```python
print("Private Puppy Age: ", puppy.get_age())

# set puppy age (private attribute)
```python

# get the updated puppy age
```python

```

# updating puppy age publicly
```python
puppy.__age = 2  # this will not change the age of the puppy
print("Failed Attempt to update age: ", puppy.get_age())
```

# creating a fox object
```python
fox = Fox("Fox")
```

# print fox name (public attribute)
```python
print("public Fox Name: ", fox.name)

# calling the bark method of the fox object
```python

The documentation includes the class Dog which has a public attribute name and a private attribute __age. It also includes the class methods bark(), get_age(), set_age(), and __str__(). The class Puppy inherits from the Dog class and the Fox class overrides the bark() method from the Dog class.

The code demonstrates creating objects from the Dog, Puppy, and Fox classes, accessing their attributes and methods, and updating the private age attribute using the `set_age
